<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Juna-Ionic was created by four students for Haaga-Helia’s Software Project II -course during Fall 2021.

The goal of the project is to create a user-friendly app that would ease the use of train travel in Finland. With the app, the user is able to select a station from the search bar, and filter by all trains stopping on the station or just commuter or long-distance trains. The user can then inspect the arrival and departure times of trains from the selected station, as well as track numbers, destination and possible delays or cancellations. In addition, the user can also check the composition of the train on a selected journey and see the number of carriages and the locations of special carriages, such as the pet car, the service car or the restaurant car, on the train.

The app uses Finntraffic’s open REST API.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started with Ionic Framework, the only requirement is a Node & npm environment.

The [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) download page has prebuilt installation packages for all platforms. We recommend selecting the LTS version to ensure best compatibility.

- npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
  
- To verify the installation, open a new terminal window and run:
    ```sh
    node --version
  
    npm --version
   ```

  

### Installation


1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bgj443/juna-ionic
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Install the Ionic CLI with npm:
   ```sh
   npm install -g @ionic/cli
   ```
4. Compiles for development
   ```sh
